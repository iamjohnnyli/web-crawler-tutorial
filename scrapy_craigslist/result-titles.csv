- Unit is a bit outdated and leaves much to be desired if you are looking for something trendy or swanky, but you should be outside enjoying all Maui has to offer anyways!!
- Perfect beach just footsteps away from your front porch 
- Great food at the shopping center just across the street (My favorite is Coconuts and the Cinnamon Roll Place), Costco and Walmart are also right next door to the airport
- I also have a great discount car rental company I always use and recommend!

The Skadi Suite is a fully-equipped curated luxury apartment on my private 1-acre homestead in lovely Leavenworth, WA. This is a recreation paradise! This location is 20 minutes from the Bavarian village of Leavenworth, 5 miles from the quaint town of Plain, 30 minutes from the restaurants and ski slopes of Steven's Pass, and 5 minutes from Kahler Glen golf resort. The Chiwawa River, Fish Lake, Lake Wenatchee, Lake Wenatchee State Park, and the Wenatchee River are minutes away. The Wenatchee National Forest is right netx to the development and there are Sno Parks all around us!

Take a day to play at Steven's Pass or Leavenworth and spend the night in Plain (halfway in between them). 

Or, take some time off and come during the week when it is quiet here - and enjoy deep discounts. And with a full kitchen, you can cook here as well. We have dates left in February - come play in the snow!

Skadi suite is minutes away from miles and miles of XC skiing, cycling, mountain biking, or hiking from the property, foraging, birding, fishing, standup paddleboarding, ziplining, horseback riding, kayaking, river rafting and so much more! You can also bring your off-road vehicle or snowmobile and access trails without even leaving my street. The property itself is a wonderful antidote to city living, as you can hear the river right across the street and the mountains are in full view. The community has direct access to 200 miles of snowmobiling and XC skiing trails, and is 30 minutes from Steven's Pass.

I offer concierge service to my guests so feel free to ask questions about how to plan an epic vacation here in Leavenworth. Your Superhost, andrea

MORE INFO:
My development is a remote neighborhood near Lake Wenatchee, Fish Lake and thousands of acres of national forest. There is a wonderful local store/XC ski hub/coffee shop called Plain Hardware as well as a little convenience store down the road with very friendly owners Gail and Michelle known as Midway Village and Grocery. We now have an incredible northern Italian farm to table restaurant at Kahler Glen Resort called Wildflour which is out of this world! Mountain Springs Lodge 5 minutes away has a great Sunday brunch as well as horseback riding, ziplining and snowmobile rentals. There are tiny riverfront cabins here as well as multi-million dollar homes. You can enjoy the Bavarian town of Leavenworth but don't have to deal with being on top of all of the traffic and tourists. Enjoy dinner and shopping in town; then retreat to your quiet mountain oasis under the stars. The location is also halfway between the village of Leavenworth and the slopes of Steven's Pass, whether you are there in the winter for top notch skiing or in the summer for the mountain bike park.

4 Bdrm 2 Ba Beach House on Skagit Bay,2019-02-27,$175,4br,LaConner,"
        
4 bedroom beach house outside of LaConner is $175. a night for 2 people. $25. per person per night additional for over 2. With 2 night minimum. Sleeps up to 10.  Weekly and monthly rates available as well. To see calendar availability and make reservations click or cut and paste the link. http://www.vrbo.com/589616  Also many more and better pictures on this site.

Our home is a beloved family getaway on the water at the end of a private lane on Skagit Bay with access to a small cove. Casual and comfortable with a Pacific Northwest feel, it's decorated with Pendleton blankets and regional art. The well equipped kitchen includes a cusinart, kitchenaid mixer, and cast iron and caphelon pots and pans.

Our house sleeps 10 in four bedrooms, each with water and island views. The downstairs master bedroom has two queen beds and is handicapped accessible. Upstairs bedrooms are furnished with one queen bed, one double bed and one twin trundle bed. Upstairs bathroom has a shower. The downstairs bath has a tub with shower and a washer and dryer. 

The open plan living space includes a large extendable dining table that can seat 10 for meals with family and friends and comfortable chairs and sofas for daytime and evening lounging. Bookcases are filled with a wide range of reading choices, from field guides and cookbooks to classics of fiction and non-fiction as well as boxes of games and puzzles for family fun.

A partly covered south facing deck provides a grand view of Martha's Bay, the North Fork of the Skagit River, the Swinomish Channel and its myriad boat traffic, and the many islands of Skagit Bay. The deck offers excellent bird watching as the tides shift, with great blue herons moving onto their feeding grounds as the water recedes, and then replaced by ducks, geese, and gulls when it returns. Eagles often fish out over the bay, and before and after fishing perch in fir trees next to our house. Seals follow schools of fish as they return on incoming tides, as do families of river otters. Dot Island, just offshore, is the home and nesting site for oystercatchers, whose sharp cries can often be heard from the house. The deck has tables and chairs and a gas grill for outdoor cooking and dining. A large steel artisan made firepit in the west side yard can be used for evening fires and roasts.

Excellent bay and estuary kayaking are a short carry and a few steps down to the adjoining cove.There is water in the cove from mid-tide and above, so tide tables must be consulted when planning trips! The cove is also an excellent place for children to explore and play under adult supervision.

The point adjacent to the cove provides a unique and commanding 270 degree view, east up the Swinomish Channel to Hole in the Wall and the entrance to La Conner, beyond to the channels of the North Fork of the Skagit, south past Goat Island to Camano Island, west to Whidby Island, and north past the Dead Man Islands and Hope Island towards the hidden passage of Deception Pass.

 Tides and water levels change dramatically twice a day affording ever changing views.
Children welcome, but yard fronts onto rocky access to tidal shoreline and young children must be under adult supervision at all times. Upstairs bedroom windows open and has no child proof bars so must remain closed and locked unless adults are present.
Wheelchair Accessible:Ground floor has level access with no steps. Downstairs bedroom with two queen beds, downstairs bathroom accessible. Upstairs is not wheelchair accessible. Ask owner for details.

Launch your kayak from adjacent cove with a short carry. Excellent 1- 6 hour kayak trips (tides depending) around Goat and Ika Islands; return through estuary channels, N. Fork Skagit and Hole in Wall. Island views abound across the water. Visible and notable are Ika, Goat, Sand, Sugarloaf, Dot, Camano and Whidbey. As tides fall sandbars emerge for herons to stalk and feed on and then submerge again. The Skagit Valley is a magic carpet of river, estuary, farmland, village and town. Regardless of season, there are crops growing, there are birds sheltering, artists, performers, and cooks at work. Watch water birds varieties from inside, from deck or yard through the day's tidal cycles. Or, if boat spotting is your thing, watch the Swinomish channel traffic directly in front across the bay.
Olympic mountains loom to the southwest above Skagit Bay and Whidbey Island. North Cascades peaks appear to the east above the North Fork of the Skagit River.The house sits on a low rock outcrop just above Skagit Bay with a hundred feet of water frontage ending in a scenic point with 270 degree water views. Nearby La Conner deserves its fame. But venture further, north across the delta to Bow-Edison, south to Conway, with a stop at Snow Goose Produce. Delightful pebble, sand and driftwood cove with short stair access just yards from house. Launch kayaks or paddleboards.

Activities nearby include Mountaineering, Mountain Climbing, Sound/Bay Fishing, Scuba Diving Or Snorkeling, Shopping, Spa, Golf, Hiking, Mountain/Road Biking, Rock Climbing, Sailing, Kayaking, Museums and Art Events, Live Theater, Bird Watching, Beachcombing, Library, Festivals, Restaurants, Marina,Eco Tourism, Sight Seeing, Whale Watching, Wildlife Viewing, Photography, Gambling Casinos, Walking, Scenic Drives
It is much like being in the San Juans without having to take a ferry. There is a cove beach that is good for launching and beaching small water craft and relaxing in. There are two boat launches within 5 minutes of the house and ample parking at the house for a number of vehicles.
The kitchen is set up with all of the basics you will need to create fabulous meals from the fresh local ingredients that the Skagit Valley is so well known for supplying our region with. If you don't feel like cooking head into La Conner, Anacortes, Mt. Vernon or Bow- Edison and check out the good eats they have. You will also find a happening art scene, live music, fun bars, and good shopping. If all of this sounds like too much and you just want to relax and do nothing you have come to the right place. It is a good place to just check out the view and enjoy all of the wild life that is constantly around.
$175. a night with a 2 night minimum. $25. a person additional charge for over 2 people. There is also a $100. cleaning fee. and taxes.

Historical Hideaway Ranch in Remote Eastern Oregon on the River near Joseph, Oregon
     Built in the 1940's by the late actor, Eugene Pallette as his hideaway from Hollywood and a refuge from potential world demise during world war 2. It took many years and many hands to create what Eugene Pallette was once ridiculed for. There was once  a cannery,  power plant, sawmill (it is a working sawmill and we mill our own lumber)  a 5,000 sq' concrete warehouse for all his provisions, a barn a herd of prize Black Angus cattle..and many industrious shops (Blacksmith etc.) a bunkhouse and mess hall  all on 3,500 acres and 10 miles of River, it became a self sustained fortress. With guests such as Clark Gable, Errol Flynn, Amelia Earhart. The list goes on..  It is now 320 acres of tranquility on 2 miles of River and while many of the buildings are still standing and utilized there are others that remain a piece of the puzzle. Also on the property is the original log home of the early settlers that traveled here in covered wagons (they are in our warehouse)  and on horseback from Kansas in the late 1800's.  We have many Lodging options for groups in our main Bunkhouse with an attached mess hall/Kitchen that is fully equipped  ( Bunkhouse capacity 21) or individuals (rent by the room) there are separate Men's/Women's restroom/ shower facilities for the bunkhouse. There is also a small 2 bed guest house with living/dining, kitchen with a private deck. There are also NUMEROUS, beautiful spots on the River to pitch a tent. And an amazing variety of wildlife to observe. Elk, deer, turkey, quail, eagles, and an occasional bear. We are a working cattle/horse Ranch so guests will have to be respectful as this is their home...

The Brünhild Bungalow is your tiny home in Plain, which is part of Leavenworth in the Wenatchee Valley. The Bungalow is a 28-foot NEW travel trailer nestled on the corner of my thickly treed property a stone's throw from the River and in full view of the Entiat mountains. Wait until you see the sunrise! It is a warm, quiet, immaculate, sunny, well-appointed, luxurious yet cozy cabin where you can recreate within walking distance and have a peaceful place for writing or reflection or just to get away from the city. Also enjoy peace and quiet and exploring the wilderness at 2000 feet. Steven's Pass has plenty of powder and we have finally been getting the snow we expect!I am also a mere 30 minutes from all the fun at Steven's Pass Mountain resort.

Brünhild Bungalow is minutes away from hundreds of miles of snowshoeing, cross-country ski trails, sledding, or snowmobiling, mountain biking, road cycling, hiking, and in the summer stand up paddleboarding, foraging for native plants and fungi, river rafting, floating etc. The Plain/Leavenworth area is a 4-season recreation destination!

There is no need to trailer your snowmobiles here, you can scoot right out from the property on your sled. XC skiers can walk 1/4 mile to trailhead or take a short drive to another one. 

For breakfast, I stock coffee for the French press, tea, milk, and sugar. If you would like to go out to eat, there are local places if you desire a sit-down option. Since the Bungalow has a full kitchen it is perfect for those who love to cook themselves and we can help advise you where to shop should you choose to make meals in house.

Because its close proximity to Vancouver (90 min drive), and being on 2 major highways (TC 1 and 3), the city has all kind of amenities for visitors - visitor centre, restaurants, parks, trails, camp grounds, cinema, golf course, balling alley, grocery and liquor stores, boutique and artisan stores, gas stations, etc. We would be happy to provide you with information and recommendations or show you around. Our property is located on the very quiet part of the city, on a cul-de-sac, the city centre is 3 min drive or 20 min walk. There is a corner-store located within 3 min walk from the house. You can also walk to the lake with beautiful beach and playground in 10 min, or you can drive for 2 min. Summer time there is a Saturday village market with lots of local artisans and crafters attending it (including my Mom with her baked goods - yumm! ). Hope is also known as the chain saw carving capital of Canada, you will find lots of carved sculptures around the town and in August there is a big annual festival. Antique car show is also happening here on Canada Day weekend (July 1st), lots of fun! After the first weekend in Sep, there is also a big celebration with fireworks. The city has a nice recreation centre, ice rink, gym, library, indoor swimming pool for public use - very affordable!

We are also close to Manning Park resort. It's only 40 min drive to this spectacular park with breathtaking hikes in the summer time and snowshoeing, snowboarding, downhill or cross country skiing or snow tubing fun activities in the winter time. Come back from your busy day in the park to soak in the hot tub and enjoy outdoor or indoor fireplace and a glass of wine.

Manson Bay is perfect for swimming, paddle boarding or drifting around on your floaty all day. Within walking distance you will find seven wine tasting rooms, a grocery store, and several quaint restaurants and shops.

"CABO SAN LUCAS, MX -  PLAYA GRANDE",2019-03-01,,None,LIVE IN EDMONDS--- RESORT IN CABO SAN LUCAS,"
        
TIME SHARE -- FOR SALE BY OWNER.  This is a genuine great deal for the right person wanting a beautiful , secure vacation place in Cabo San Lucas.   We've  stayed each year on the ""Ridge"" at Play Grande and the infinity pools that overlook the Pacific and Cabo San Lucas are spectacular.  

I'm not going to rave on about Playa Grande. You are either aware of this wonderful secure resort, or you can look it up.    But, you can get some great pictures of the report on their website:  https://playagranderesort.solmar.com
The pictures shown here are those we took on one of our visits. 

We have a ""floating week"" contract for weeks between 15 and 45.   So, you are not locked in to the same week (or room)  each year.  The annual maintenance fee is $949.95 which we’ve paid this year. That’s very good for 7 days in Cabo at a nice secure resort within walking distance of the marina and town.  You can “bank” the week for $89.00 if you want to add the week to a future year. 

This is my first attempt to sell our time share by this method on Craigslist.  

I've talked to too many 
""con men/ women"" bogus time share sellers to know that the only way that I will sell it is directly to a buyer.  I’m getting lots of inquiries and I’m trying to update this ad with as much info as possible.  

If you are a Salesperson, Consultant or Real Estate Broker,  don't waste my time or yours.   I have a pretty good ""BS"" meter.  I'm tired of AZ, TX and FL boiler room hustlers trying to hustle me, so don't try.  

This is genuine great deal.  We would like $3,800.  This will fund the Attorney fees and we’ve paid this year's maintenance fee.  The reason that I'm selling.  I'm 75 years old and my health is limiting travel.  Sadly, my kids don't want it, so I'm going to let some one else enjoy this wonderful place.

Amazing, comfortable, decorative, ultra clean, short walk to beach, sipping wine waiting after our long drive, no wind, contemporary, hot tub of my dreams, BBQ every night, yea for wireless, espresso every morning, staring at the ocean having lunch on the deck, memories forever. . .. . .. . .. . ..thanks. . .. . .. . . Sharon, Tennessee

This is the ultimate kid-friendly home! From the stroller, high chair, porta-crib down to the many toys, games, and books, books, books, it has been one of the best vacations we have ever had. It saved us bringing all of these things which is a big deal for us. You may be hearing from our friends because we have recommended your home to them ~ the kids (and we) cannot wait to come back ~ maybe for some winter storms next time! Jessica, Idaho

We spent our honeymoon here at The Waves House and everything about the house, the whole area, and the beach exceeded our expectations. It was even better than the photos online. We appreciate the hot tub, espresso machine (!) and the views of the ocean a lot. Hopefully, we will have our first anniversary at The Waves House next year! Heather, Arizona

Westport RV Site near the Beach  $20. night,2019-03-03,$20,None,Westport,"
        
The site is a short walk (less than 5 minutes) to the beach and is located at 102 C. Bonge St, Westport, 98595 (google for overhead pic) which is just past the State Park on Hwy 105. You can walk on a blacktop road to the beach. You may want to Google the address to get an idea. There are no laundry/shower facilities but you do have more room and privacy than in a regular RV park.

  Prefer no more than two or three  people. The area where you would be camping would be in front of the house and you can park in the driveway area, a little to the right,  with your vehicle and RV. There are some small redwood landscaping timbers to the right and you could park anywhere in the driveway over to these timbers. There is a water spigot to hook to and a 30 amp plug. If you need sewer hook up there is a sewer line you could hook into. We ask that you take your garbage with you after your stay.

We do not live in the area so you need to contact me to make sure the site is available.
Winter Rates as of September 1st:Rent is $20 a night, $50 for 3 nights/4 days, or $100 for 7 nights, which includes water, sewer and electricity. Prefer 3 night minimum for major holidays. You can google the site at: 102 Bonge, Westport 98595

King bed configuration can be yours using the conversion kit provided. Downstairs in the living room, a Queen-sized sofa sleeper gives added flexibility such that four people can have their own bed.

The indoor pool is just one block away. Keep walking another block to get to town. Continue on to Seabrook's main staircase to the beach.

Rocky Bay Retreat,2019-03-04,$179,3br,Gig Harbor,"
        
This amazing Northwest home is large and located right on the beach. Lots of windows mean that it is well lit and the decks on every floor will allow you access to the most amazing views.

Walk the short flat path and you'll find yourself on a gravelly beach with wonderful West facing views. Take a good book and enjoy the tides as they come in and out.

The bay is shallow and unlike many salt water locations, the water gets warm enough to swim in. In fact, the owners do it for hours. Better yet, bring your boat! You can actually beach it right up by the sitting area at high tide.

Inside, the home is immaculately decorated with all the modern convinces. There are three bedrooms and two baths, but the home actually sleeps up to 12. 

The kitchen is modern with all of the best features. It's fully stocked with pots, pans, dinner ware and anything else you'll need to cook up a good meal. Be sure to bring briquettes for the charcoal BBQ.

Visit us at rockybayretreat.com for more info and/or booking!

Talk about a view! Talk about a view! Sorry, but everyone loves the view. Every room in Haven Hideaway has spectacular scenes of the beach, the dunes, and the ocean.

In addition to the views, the home is truly beachfront with a stream and, did I say, incredible views?

Our family loves it here. The place sleeps 6 in 3 bedrooms so you can bring your friends or the kids and grandma. That way everyone is ready for scenic fun at the beach.

Have you been to Copalis Beach before? We are North of Ocean Shores, quieter but still a quick drive into the restaurants, shops, bike and moped rentals, horse biking riding and more.

You can walk directly out to the beach. There is stream you can wade most of the year. In winter the small  bridge is just 2 blocks north. Either way it's a joy to feel the ocean air, see the birds and experience the mighty Pacific Ocean.

The kitchen is fully outfitted with pots, pans, oven and range. For the table you'll find plates, flat ware and more. You can make a nice family dinner here without feeling cramped.

Grizzly Hideaway,2019-03-04,$149,3br,Leavenworth,"
        
It has been a long while since grizzly bears roamed the North Cascade mountain range near the Bavarian theme town of Leavenworth. But, they are making a comeback so we decided to name our big beautiful condo after those majestic creatures - Grizzly Hideaway.

There are very few three bedroom homes of this size within the Leavenworth village area, but we have one. Located in Alpine Village we are about a mile from the middle of town, but visitors enjoy the stroll as they admire the Bavarian architecture.

The Grizzly Hideaway location is quiet and pristine with towering mature evergreen trees and easy parking. There are three bedrooms and two baths - one is full sized, one is three quarters.

Merry Canyon,2019-03-04,$199,3br,Leavenworth,"
        
This is the story of Merry Canyon Lodge - one family’s dream to build a remote lodge above the Bavarian Theme town of Leavenworth in the alp-like mountains of Washington State; where they and guests can build memories to last a lifetime.

The dream began when the family attended the annual Christmas Lighting festival. Visitors from around the country and world, sing carols in the fluffy falling snow as millions of lights burst into color, generating smiles and gasps of joy.

From Merry Canyon it is just 11 miles to the village center. Make your way down a winding road, past farms, trees and the famous Northern Pacific Railway.   

The family wanted privacy, peace and quiet, while also being close enough to the restaurants and shops. The desire to be apart of the frequent music, dance and art fun within Leavenworth was important to maintain. 

The exquisite Merry Canyon Lodge was built with all the comforts of a home, blended seamlessly with the touches of the forest life that city dwellers yearn for.  From country furniture to a bubbling hot tub, here guests can get away like never before.

These are one room cabins with a full bathroom and an equipped kitchenette. Each cabin has one queen-sized bed. Wake up in the woods, get your coffee going, and step out onto the front porch with that hot mug. You may see a cow wander by in the summer and are sure to cross paths with wildlife.

B209 WaveCrest Resort Molokai Hawaii,2019-03-05,$630,1br,Molokai Hawaii,"
        
If you want to get away from it all, you owe it to yourself to checkout the island of Molokai. This beautiful unspoiled island is just the place to relax and see Hawaii the way it used to be. It's hard to believe that there are no crowds on some of the most beautiful beaches in all of Hawaii. Take a step back and ""Slow Down, You're on Molokai"". There are no stop lights on the whole island. The maximum speed limit is 45 miles per hour and No big box stores.

WaveCrest resort is the perfect place to get away from it all. It's 13 miles from the largest town on the island, Kaunakakai. The ride to the resort from town is a gorgeous coastal ride with views of Maui and Lanai on the way. The resort has a great pool and covered Cabana area by the pool with restrooms and BBQ grills for you to use. All right on the ocean with views of Maui and Lanai. On clear days you can even see the Big Island and Kaho'olawe.

Now for our condo, it's in the B building which is placed to take maximum advantage of the trade winds. There is no A/C but the trades blow right through the unit to keep it cool. The lanai is large, 100 sq-ft so you can relax out there and take in the trad winds while watching the whales between Maui and Molokai in the winter. You can also check out the majestic sea cliffs behind the resort. It reminds me of Napali coming right down behind the C building at the WaveCrest resort. The condo is on the second floor and note there are no elevators which is common on Molokai.

We just added new furniture and TV to our Condo.

The condo itself is over 600 sq-ft and easily sleeps 4. The bedroom has a queen bed and the sofa folds out into a queen also. We have been doing some upgrading since buying the condo and have added new towels and linens along with a new microwave. We also added some beach towels and chairs for our guests to use. For those of you that need to stay connected we have also added high speed internet with WiFi.

Keep watching this page as I will be adding places to go and things to do while on the island. The island is just a short 15 minute flight from Oahu or Maui so there is easy access. It's only about a half hour flight from either the Big Island or Kauai.

Pricing for the WaveCrest Condo on Molokai starts at $630 per week. Below is a link where you can get more information and information about booking online.

This condo will make a perfect second week to add to your Hawaiian vacation!!    "

For the first time ever the world renowned Bed and Breakfast, Casa Panoramica in beautiful Puerto Vallarta, Mexico is looking for long term tenants.  This is an incredible opportunity that you won't want to pass up.  This gorgeous 7 bedroom, 8.5 bathroom home was built in 1971 by the legendary architect Guillermo Wulff in his now iconic Vallarta style.  The home is located on Carretera a Barra de Navidad just a five minute walk from the Romantic Zone and Playa de Los Muertos.

The two houses are securely separated with independent entrances and divided by lush tropical foliage to give each section a private, secluded feeling.

Sharon, Tennessee

This is the ultimate kid-friendly home! From the stroller, high chair, porta-crib down to the many toys, games, and books, books, books, it has been one of the best vacations we have ever had. It saved us bringing all of these things which is a big deal for us. You may be hearing from our friends because we have recommended your home to them ~ the kids (and we) cannot wait to come back ~ maybe for some winter storms next time! Jessica, Idaho

We spent our honeymoon here at The Waves House and everything about the house, the whole area, and the beach exceeded our expectations. It was even better than the photos online. We appreciate the hot tub, espresso machine (!) and the views of the ocean a lot. Hopefully, we will have our first anniversary at The Waves House next year! Heather, Arizona

Relax Lodge,2019-03-05,$199,3br,Leavenworth,"
        
Don’t relax just yet, wait until you get here. In fact, it is almost impossible not to slow down at Relax Lodge, unless of course you are taking on some of the active outdoor activities in the area.

In fact, you can do both - keep on the run with activities and later snuggle back in at Relax Lodge into the over stuffed furniture. Warm your toes in front of the wood burning stove and yes - and yes - plunge into the warm and inviting hot tub.

The temp is just right, right now awaiting your visit.

Calling all clams: It's time to cross on over to the ocean! Clam Crossing cottage awaits in you in the heart of Ocean Shores.

This cute one-story home is located just a short, ten minute walk from the beach front where you and your family (or friends too), can soak up the sun, play in the waves and maybe dig up some clams if it's the right season.


This is a one story, two bedroom home with a single, full sized bathroom. The master bedroom is home to a king size bed, while the second bedroom contains a queen. Four guests can make use of the beds, but if your party includes a fifth the couch is very comfortable!

The bedrooms are stocked with fluffy pillows and cozy linens, while the bathroom is kept stocked with fresh towels. Our housekeepers provide hospitality-grade housekeeping, ensuring that your stay will be a real""home-away-from-home""experience.

Clam Crossing has a full kitchen including the basic pots, pans, and flatware needed to accompany any meal you may whip up during your stay. But if your idea of a vacation means no cooking then make the short trip into ttown where you'll find plenty of delicious local eats!

The front yard has plenty of grassy green space for you and your family to sprawl out on. There's plenty of room for kids to run wild or play yard games while you just relax.

You'll also notice the deck that is situated at the front of the home. It's perfect for kicking back and enjoying the sun or even just spending a few hours with a good book. 

We do offer WiFi and a smart TV for kicking back at the end of the night. 

Clam Crossing is perfect for anyone looking for a getaway near the ocean - whether that be a romantic weekend away for two, a family outing or even a quiet vacation for one! It's such a short walk to the beach meaning you can come back after a day in the sand and kick back for the evening. 

Visit us at ClamCrossing.com for more info and/or booking!

Here is what our Guests are saying about Pacifica House ~

We couldn't get over how beautiful Pacifica House was from the moment we walked inside -- the views of the ocean from the kitchen, dining and living room are spectacular. I just loved looking at the ocean at the same time I was making dinner!! Wow. I just walked around staring at all the photographs on the walls -- it is like a museum! My favorite room is the Master Bathroom -- you can see the ocean while you shower in the see-through shower! Please don't ever sell this house -- we will be back. . .. . .. . ..soon! Barb, Nevada

This is the nicest rental we have ever stayed at -- we cannot thank you enough for making memories to last a lifetime. I wanted to ask where you got your beds -- they are just perfect for my back. There is so much room in the great room to visit, read, play games, watch TV and DVDs too. We liked being able to sit at the ""bar"" sipping wine and talking to the ""chef"" making dinner! This house is a home away from home -- it just has that feel. Very close beach access which we appreciated. You can be sure we'll return. We have found a treasure. Hannah, Arizona

Thank you thank you especially for all the toys, books, etc. for the kids -- it rained nonstop almost our entire weekend so these were much appreciated and made our weekend wonderful. Renting a home instead of a hotel gave us the ability to just sit and talk and laugh together which we needed. What great separation of the bedroom suites ~ the kids at the ""other end"" of the house!! So we could sleep in! Tammy, Oregon
